## Installation

This repo isn't packaged as a ".crx" extension (working on getting that from Google). Installing it thus requires enabling "Developer mode" from the extensions' page. 

1. Download this repo as zip file and unzip it. 
2. Click the "Load unpacked extesions..." button from extensions' page.
3. Select the folder you just unzipped and Voila!
