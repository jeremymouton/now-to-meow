# now-to-meow

Google Chrome extension to replace to word "now" with "meow".
Forked from [panicsteve/cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt).

## Installation

This repo isn't packaged as a ".crx" extension (working on getting that from Google). Installing it currently requires enabling "Developer mode" from the extensions' page. 

1. Download this repo as a zip file and unzip it.
2. Click the "Load unpacked extensions..." button from the extensions' page.
3. Select the folder you just unzipped and voila!

Reload this Github page and you should now see this repo called meow-to-meow.
